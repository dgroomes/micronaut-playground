ðŸ“š Learning and experimenting with Micronaut framework <https://micronaut.io/>.

## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `basic/`

This sub-project is a "hello world" Micronaut application.

See the README in [basic/](basic/).

### `config/`

This sub-project showcases configuration features of Micronaut like externalized configuration.

See the README in [config/](config/).
