## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `basic/`

This is a "Hello World" Micronaut application.

See the README in [basic/](basic/).

### `beans/`

This project illustrates Micronaut bean concepts like lifecycle scopes and the `BeanContext`.

See the README in [beans/](beans/).

### `config/`

This showcases configuration features of Micronaut like environments and externalized configuration.

See the README in [config/](config/). 

### `sql/`

An example Micronaut application that accesses a SQL database using *Micronaut Data*.

See the README in [sql/](sql/).
